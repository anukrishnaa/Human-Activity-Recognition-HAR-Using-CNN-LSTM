# Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR-Using-CNN-LSTM

This project focuses on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) by leveraging a CNN-LSTM model. The CNN extracts spatial features from the input data, while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, making it effective for recognizing activities from time-series data such as sensor readings from wearable devices.
